# student_astar.py
# ============================================================
# TASK
#   Implement A* search that returns (path, cost).
#
# SIGNATURE (do not change):
#   astar(start, goal, neighbors_fn, heuristic_fn, trace) -> (List[Coord], float)
#
# PARAMETERS
#   start, goal:           grid coordinates
#   neighbors_fn(u):       returns valid 4-neighbors of u
#   heuristic_fn(u, goal): returns a non-negative estimate to goal
#   trace:                 MUST call trace.expand(u) whenever you pop u
#                         from the PRIORITY QUEUE to expand it.
#
# EDGE COSTS
#   Assume unit step cost (=1) unless your runner specifies otherwise.
#   (If your runner supplies a graph.cost(u,v), adapt here if needed.)
#
# RETURN
#   (path, cost) where path is the list of coordinates from start to goal,
#   and cost is the sum of step costs along that path (float).
#   If no path exists, return ([], 0.0).
#
# IMPLEMENTATION HINT
# - Use min-heap over f = g + h.
# - Keep g[u] (cost from start), parent map, and a closed set.
# - On goal, reconstruct path and also compute cost (sum of steps).
